## Overview

The extension provides two primary functions:

- **Password Generation:** Users can generate a random password based on customizable criteria.  
- **Password Strength Checking:** Users can paste or type a password into the tool to get real-time feedback on its strength, including details about the types of characters used.

Key functionalities include:
- Selection of password length (ranging from 6 to 15 characters).
- Option to include/exclude various character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols).
- Visual feedback on the complexity and strength of the generated or entered password.
- Ability to easily copy the password to the clipboard.

## Features

### 1. Password Generator
- **Length Selector:**  
  - Input method (slider or numeric field) that enforces a minimum of 6 characters and a maximum of 15 characters.
- **Character Type Options:**  
  - Checkboxes for:
    - Uppercase Letters (A-Z)
    - Lowercase Letters (a-z)
    - Numbers (0-9)
    - Symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*()-_=+)
- **Generate Button:**  
  - When clicked, creates a random password using the selected criteria.
- **Validation:**  
  - If no character type is selected, display an error message prompting the user to choose at least one option.

### 2. Password Strength Checker
- **Real-Time Analysis:**  
  - As a password is generated or manually entered, the extension analyzes its strength.
- **Strength Metrics:**  
  - Evaluation based on:
    - Length of the password.
    - Diversity of character types (how many of the selected categories are represented).
  - Display a strength rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong) with corresponding visual indicators (e.g., progress bar, color-coded feedback).
- **Character Type Display:**  
  - Clearly indicate which character types are present in the password.

### 3. Utility Functions
- **Copy to Clipboard:**  
  - A button to copy the generated or entered password for easy use.
- **Clear Function:**  
  - Option to clear the current password and reset selections.
- **Responsive Error Handling:**  
  - Informative messages when input criteria are not met (e.g., password length out of range or no character types selected).

## User Flow

1. **Extension Activation:**  
   - User clicks the browser extension icon, which opens a popup window.

2. **Initial UI Presentation:**  
   - The popup displays:
     - A numeric input or slider for setting password length (6 to 15 characters).
     - Checkboxes for each character type (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
     - A text field for manual password input (optional) for strength checking.
     - A "Generate Password" button.
     - A "Copy to Clipboard" button (initially disabled or hidden until a password is generated).

3. **Password Generation:**  
   - User selects desired password length and character types.
   - On clicking "Generate Password":
     - The extension validates inputs.
     - If valid, it randomly constructs a password using the selected criteria.
     - The generated password is displayed in the text field.
     - The extension immediately analyzes the password strength and shows visual feedback (e.g., a colored bar or text indicator).

4. **Password Strength Check (Manual or Automatic):**  
   - If the user manually enters a password:
     - The extension continuously evaluates and updates the strength indicator.
   - Display which character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) are present.

5. **Copy & Clear Actions:**  
   - User can click "Copy to Clipboard" to quickly use the generated password.
   - Optionally, a "Clear" button allows resetting the input fields and selections.

## UI & UX Design

### Layout
- **Header:**  
  - Title: "Password Strength Checker & Generator"
- **Main Area:**  
  - **Password Length Selector:**  
    - Slider and/or numeric input with clear min (6) and max (15) indicators.
  - **Character Type Options:**  
    - A group of checkboxes with labels.
  - **Password Field:**  
    - Text input area displaying the generated or user-entered password.
  - **Feedback Panel:**  
    - A dynamic strength meter that might include:
      - A progress bar.
      - Text feedback such as "Weak," "Moderate," or "Strong."
    - A list or icons showing active character types.
- **Footer:**  
  - Action buttons: "Generate Password," "Copy to Clipboard," and "Clear."

### Design Considerations
- **Responsiveness:**  
  - Ensure the UI adapts well to various screen sizes.
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Use clear labels, keyboard navigability, and ARIA attributes where appropriate.
- **Simplicity:**  
  - Keep the interface minimalistic and intuitive, focusing on ease of use.

## Technical Specifications

### Front-End Technologies
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:**  
  - The core technologies to build the popup interface.
- **Browser Extension APIs:**  
  - Utilize the browser’s extension API (e.g., Chrome Extensions API, WebExtensions for Firefox) for functionalities like clipboard access.

### Password Generation Logic
- **Randomization:**  
  - Implement secure randomization using JavaScript’s built-in cryptographic functions (e.g., `window.crypto.getRandomValues`).
- **Validation:**  
  - Ensure that the generated password adheres to the length and character type selections.
- **Edge Cases:**  
  - Provide fallback messages or adjustments when user selections are insufficient (e.g., if user selects only one character type for a longer length).

### Password Strength Evaluation
- **Criteria:**  
  - Evaluate based on:
    - Length (longer passwords are generally stronger).
    - Mix of character types.
  - Optional: Include additional heuristics (e.g., avoiding common patterns).

### Data Flow
1. **User Input:**  
   - Capture selections (password length, character types).
2. **Processing:**  
   - Validate input.
   - Generate or evaluate password.
3. **Output:**  
   - Display generated password.
   - Update strength meter and character type display.
4. **Utility Actions:**  
   - Copy to clipboard functionality.
   - Reset/clear input fields.
